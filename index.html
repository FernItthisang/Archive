                <p>Hello! I'm Fern Itthisang</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm a designer who is passionate about data visualization, interactive design, and creating human-centric digital experiences. My journey began with architecture, where I learned to visualize space and create environments that resonate with human experience. Over time, I discovered that data could tell stories too—stories that shape how we perceive and understand the world.</p>
                <p>This realization led me to explore <b>the intersection of design, technology, and human interaction.</b> I began to see both architects and data visualizers as storytellers—crafting narratives that connect people to spaces, ideas, and information.</p>
            </div></div>

            <div class="box collapsed"><div class="box-title"><div class="icon"><span class="arrow">↗</span></div>Where I Am Now?</div><div class="content">
                <p>Right now, I'm pursuing my studies in <b>Computational Design Practices (CDP) at GSAPP, Columbia University.</b> It's an exciting journey, where I'm constantly challenged to think about how technology can reshape our relationship with space and data.</p>
                <p>In 2024, I received my degree in <b> M.S. in Data Visualization from Parsons School of Design</b>, where I honed my ability to transform complex data into clear, insightful visuals. This education solidified my belief that design is not just about aesthetics but about making information accessible and meaningful.</p>

            <div class="box collapsed"><div class="box-title"><div class="icon"><span class="arrow">↗</span></div>What Drives Me?</div><div class="content">
                <p>I am driven by a simple yet powerful idea: <b>technology should feel human.</b> Whether I'm working on data-driven storytelling, designing interactive interfaces, or prototyping AI-driven experiences, I approach each project with the mindset of a storyteller. I believe that the most impactful designs are those that resonate emotionally while solving practical problems.</p>
                <p>My current interests are rooted in exploring how AI can make technology more intuitive and adaptive. I see a future where interactive systems not only respond to human input but also understand and anticipate human needs.</p>                
            </div></div>

                <p>I see design as a bridge between people and technology—a way to make the digital world feel more alive and human-centered. I believe that thoughtful design can transform our interactions with machines, making them feel less like tools and more like companions. </p>
                <p>As I continue to evolve as a designer, I am committed to exploring how data, AI, and interaction design can shape a more empathetic and connected future.</p>

                        This project reimagines a robotic vacuum as a living companion, blending emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and adaptive behavior. Named "Cee" (Companion, Cohabitant, Continuum), it integrates four personas—Butler, Fortuneteller, Therapist, and Cleaner—each offering unique interactions and movements.

                        Cee actively engages with its surroundings, responding to human presence and environmental changes with expressive OLED eyes and voice feedback. The Butler welcomes guests, the Fortuneteller predicts the day, the Therapist offers comfort, and the Cleaner maintains tidiness without intrusion.
                        
                        By combining AI-driven emotional responses, contextual dialogue, and adaptive movement, Cee transforms routine cleaning into a dynamic cohabitation experience.

                        <p>A unique perspective on urban spaces through the lens of a Roomba vacuum cleaner. This project examines how autonomous devices like the Roomba perceive and move through our living environments. It looks at how these devices interact with everyday spaces and how they make decisions while navigating. By studying the Roomba's movements and reactions, the project offers insights into how technology and spatial awareness intersect in our homes.</p>

                        <p>This concept played an important role in the research for the capstone project, Companion, Cohabitant, and Continuum (Cee). The idea was to see the world from the Roomba's point of view and use that perspective to better understand the relationship between robotic companions and domestic spaces. To achieve this, the project used the idea of rendering—a way to visualize how the Roomba perceives its surroundings. Additionally, a short story was created to imagine the Roomba's experiences and how it might interpret the space around it. This helped shape the project's direction by highlighting how robotic companions might feel more integrated and connected to the spaces they inhabit.</p>

                        <p>The goal is to better understand the visual language of protests—how symbols, signs, and actions come together to convey powerful messages. Through analyzing data from various movements, the project reveals the connections between different acts of solidarity and highlights the complex ways communities come together to make their voices heard.</p>

                        <p>An investigation into transportation equity and accessibility in urban environments. This project visualizes the disparities in public transit access and proposes solutions for more equitable transportation systems. It is an interactive memory walkthrough built in Unity that reconstructs fragments of New York City subway stations. The project uses scanned elements—like mosaic walls, cracked tiles, benches, and trash cans—to create layered stories about how people occupy transit spaces in ways that are often overlooked. To convey this perspective, the project adopts a lower angle, resembling a third-person view from the perspective of a rat.</p>

                        <p>The focus is on how public infrastructure, such as the subway, can simultaneously serve as shelter and exclusion. Some people easily tap through OMNY gates and ride the trains, while others claim benches or corners as their homes. I wanted to explore this contrast between mobility and immobility within the same space.</p>
                        
                        <p>By incorporating elements like fog, spotlighting, and ambient sound, users experience these zones not as typical transit spaces but as memory spaces—places that hold traces of lived survival. Each interactive object reveals a fragment of someone's life: a person who slept on a bench, played music in a corner, or simply tried to stay warm during harsh conditions.</p>
                        
                        <p>The project is inspired by a climate justice perspective, questioning how cities prepare for environmental challenges while leaving vulnerable people exposed underground. It reflects on how ordinary infrastructure becomes quietly political—not just in terms of who moves through the station, but who is allowed to stay.</p>
                        
                        <p>My intention was not to simulate homelessness, but to reflect on how everyday public spaces, like subway stations, carry silent stories of both shelter and displacement. The project encourages viewers to think about the hidden lives within urban infrastructure and to consider the social implications of transit accessibility.</p>
