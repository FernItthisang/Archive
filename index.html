                <p>Hello! I'm Fern Itthisang</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm a designer who is passionate about data visualization, interactive design, and creating human-centric digital experiences. My journey began with architecture, where I learned to visualize space and create environments that resonate with human experience. Over time, I discovered that data could tell stories too—stories that shape how we perceive and understand the world.</p>
                <p>This realization led me to explore <b>the intersection of design, technology, and human interaction.</b> I began to see both architects and data visualizers as storytellers—crafting narratives that connect people to spaces, ideas, and information.</p>
            </div></div>

            <div class="box collapsed"><div class="box-title"><div class="icon"><span class="arrow">↗</span></div>Where I Am Now?</div><div class="content">
                <p>Right now, I'm pursuing my studies in <b>Computational Design Practices (CDP) at GSAPP, Columbia University.</b> It's an exciting journey, where I'm constantly challenged to think about how technology can reshape our relationship with space and data.</p>
                <p>In 2024, I received my degree in <b> M.S. in Data Visualization from Parsons School of Design</b>, where I honed my ability to transform complex data into clear, insightful visuals. This education solidified my belief that design is not just about aesthetics but about making information accessible and meaningful.</p>

            <div class="box collapsed"><div class="box-title"><div class="icon"><span class="arrow">↗</span></div>What Drives Me?</div><div class="content">
                <p>I am driven by a simple yet powerful idea: <b>technology should feel human.</b> Whether I'm working on data-driven storytelling, designing interactive interfaces, or prototyping AI-driven experiences, I approach each project with the mindset of a storyteller. I believe that the most impactful designs are those that resonate emotionally while solving practical problems.</p>
                <p>My current interests are rooted in exploring how AI can make technology more intuitive and adaptive. I see a future where interactive systems not only respond to human input but also understand and anticipate human needs.</p>

                <p>I see design as a bridge between people and technology—a way to make the digital world feel more alive and human-centered. I believe that thoughtful design can transform our interactions with machines, making them feel less like tools and more like companions. </p>
                <p>As I continue to evolve as a designer, I am committed to exploring how data, AI, and interaction design can shape a more empathetic and connected future.</p>

                    This project reimagines a robotic vacuum as a living companion, blending emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and adaptive behavior. Named "Cee" (Companion, Cohabitant, Continuum), it integrates four personas—Butler, Fortuneteller, Therapist, and Cleaner—each offering unique interactions and movements.

                    Cee actively engages with its surroundings, responding to human presence and environmental changes with expressive OLED eyes and voice feedback. The Butler welcomes guests, the Fortuneteller predicts the day, the Therapist offers comfort, and the Cleaner maintains tidiness without intrusion.
                    
                    By combining AI-driven emotional responses, contextual dialogue, and adaptive movement, Cee transforms routine cleaning into a dynamic cohabitation experience.

This project explores how autonomous devices perceive and navigate our living environments, offering insights into the intersection of domestic technology and spatial awareness. which is the part that I use for reserach for the capstone project or Companion, Cohabitant and Continuum (Cee) to understanding and scoping out the project by using the idea of rendering to understand the perspective of Roomba and creating the short story of the Roomba.
